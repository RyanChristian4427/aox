To build Oryx Mailstore from source, you need the Jam build tool,
available at http://www.perforce.com/jam/jam.html as well as in most
Linux/BSD distributions.

Simply edit Jamsettings to reflect your preferences and type 'jam' or
'jam install' to build. Note that in Jam, variable assignments require
spaces: "A = b ;" is good, "A=b;" is a syntax error.

If you encounter any problems, please write to info@oryx.com.
