See http://www.archiveopteryx.org/overview.html for an introduction.


Requirements
------------

You need g++ (and associated packages) to build this software.

You need to have PostgreSQL installed to use Archiveopteryx. We
recommend the latest 8.x version (but anything newer than 7.4.2
should work; see http://www.archiveopteryx.org/postgresql/).


Installation
------------

For detailed installation instructions, see:
http://www.archiveopteryx.org/installation.html

Here's a brief overview:

1. Type "make" to compile the software.

   (You shouldn't need to change any of the compile-time settings in
   Jamsettings, but if you do, you'll have to use "jam" to build the
   software instead. See http://www.archiveopteryx.org/jam.html)

2. Type "make install" (or "jam install") as root to install the
   software into /usr/local/archiveopteryx (then switch to that
   directory to continue).

   The archiveopteryx(7) manual page introduces the software.

   (You may want to add /usr/local/archiveopteryx/man to your MANPATH.)

3. Run "lib/installer" to create a Unix user and group, a PostgreSQL
   user, the necessary database tables, and to generate an initial
   configuration file.

   See installer(8) for details, or run "lib/installer -n" to see what
   commands the installer would run, without running them.

   See archiveopteryx.conf(5) for details about the configuration file.

4. Start the servers: "bin/ms start".

   ms is the command-line administration tool for Archiveopteryx.
   See ms(8) or run "bin/ms help" for usage instructions.

   The servers write log output to /usr/local/archiveopteryx/logfile.

   (To start the servers automatically at boot, use lib/archiveopteryx
   as an init script.)

5. Create some users, e.g. with:

       bin/ms add user nirmala pwd nirmala@example.com

   Archiveopteryx will create a user named nirmala (with password "pwd")
   and accept mail sent to the given address, and store it in a mailbox
   named /users/nirmala/INBOX, which can be accessed via IMAP or POP.

6. Configure your MTA to deliver incoming mail into Archiveopteryx via
   LMTP (or via bin/deliver, if your MTA doesn't speak LMTP). See, e.g.
   http://www.archiveopteryx.org/postfix.html and exim.html for details.
