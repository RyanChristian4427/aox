See http://www.archiveopteryx.org/overview.html for an introduction
and http://www.archiveopteryx.org/$VERSION.html for information about
version $VERSION.


Requirements
------------

You need g++ (and associated packages) to build this software.

You need to have PostgreSQL installed to use Archiveopteryx. We
recommend the latest 8.x version (but anything newer than 7.4.2
should work; see http://www.archiveopteryx.org/postgresql/).


Installation
------------

For detailed installation instructions, see:
http://www.archiveopteryx.org/installation.html

Here's a brief overview:

1. Type "make" to compile the software.

   (You shouldn't need to change any of the compile-time settings in
   Jamsettings, but if you do, you'll have to use "jam" to build the
   software instead. See http://www.archiveopteryx.org/jam.html)

2. Type "make install" (or "jam install") as root to install the
   software into $PREFIX (then switch to that
   directory to continue).

   The archiveopteryx(7) manual page introduces the software.

   (You may want to add $MANDIR to your MANPATH.)

3. Run "lib/installer" to create a Unix user and group, a PostgreSQL
   user, the necessary database tables, and to generate an initial
   configuration file.

   See installer(8) for details, or run "lib/installer -n" to see what
   commands the installer would run, without running them.

   The generated configuration file should work fine, but you may need
   to edit it, for example, to enable POP3, or make the servers listen
   on some interface other than localhost. See archiveopteryx.conf(5)
   for more details.

4. Start the servers: "bin/aox start".

   ms is the command-line administration tool for Archiveopteryx.
   See aox(8) or run "bin/aox help" for usage instructions.

   The servers write log output to $LOGFILE.

   (To start the servers automatically at boot, use lib/archiveopteryx
   as an init script.)

5. Create some users, e.g. with:

       bin/aox add user nirmala pwd nirmala@example.com

   Archiveopteryx will create a user named nirmala (with password "pwd")
   and accept mail sent to the given address, and store it in a mailbox
   named /users/nirmala/INBOX, which can be accessed via IMAP or POP.

6. Configure your MTA to deliver incoming mail into Archiveopteryx via
   LMTP (or via bin/deliver, if your MTA doesn't speak LMTP). See, e.g.
   http://www.archiveopteryx.org/postfix.html and exim.html for details.
