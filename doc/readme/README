To build Oryx Mailstore from source, you need the Jam build tool,
available at http://www.perforce.com/jam/jam.html as well as in most
Linux/BSD distributions.

To run Mailstore you need PostgreSQL, version 7.4.7 or any later
version.

Building and installing Mailstore is a five-step process:

1. Edit Jamsettings to reflect your preferences. Note that in Jam,
   variable assignments require spaces: "A = b ;" is good, "A=b;" is a
   syntax error.

2. Type 'jam install' to build and install the beast.

3. Run BINDIR/installer (/usr/local/mailstore/bin/installer by
   default). This will create the PostgreSQL infrastructure needed and
   write a stub configuration file.

4. Edit CONFIGDIR/mailstore.conf to suit your needs. By default, that's
   /usr/local/mailstore/mailstore.conf. The man page for mailstore.conf
   explains all the possible settings.

5. Create the Mailstore users you need, e.g.

       ms create user nirmala pw nirmala@example.org

   to create a user with login 'heidi', password 'pw' and email
   address nirmala@example.org.

At this point, you're ready to run BINDIR/rcmailstore start to start
Mailstore. After a change, rcmailstore restart restarts.
