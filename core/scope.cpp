/*! \class Scope scope.h
    A mechanism to save and restore context between scopes.

    A scope allows parts of the code to change global state (such as the
    current log) during execution, and restore it afterwards. Objects
    of this class should be declared as automatic variables so that the
    destructor is called when execution leaves the lexical scope.

    Note that the root scope must be declared with an explicit log, or
    the first logging statement will fail.

    In order to keep track of scopes, there are some rules: If Scope a
    is created before Scope b, b must be deleted before a. Really
    deleted, Allocator::free() will not free them.
