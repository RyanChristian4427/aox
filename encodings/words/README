This dictionary contains list of common words in UTF-8. Each file is
named for a language and contains common words in that language, one
word per line.

Any lines starting with '#' are disregarded.

A note regarding licensing:

The code and data in this directory are licensed under the OSL 2.1 by
virtue of being in this source tree. Please write to info@oryx.com if
that's a problem for you. If anyone else wants to use this algorithm,
we'll be very flexible.

The data files in this directory are based on the following sources:

1. http://wortschatz.uni-leipzig.de/html/wliste.html

   The files german.words, dutch.words and french.words are based on
   Wortschatz material, transcoded to UTF-8.

2. Eva Schlittermann via email

   The file czech.words is largely based on a list supplied by Eva
   Schlittermann. Supplements desired.

3. These ten pages contain the 10,000 most frequent words in Norwegian
   newspapers, as counted by the University of Oslo's Tekstlab project
   (http://www.hf.uio.no/tekstlab/).

   The original web pages have been deleted sometime since we fetched
   them. Archive.org has copies:

   .../aviser.frek2.html etc
   ...
   .../aviser.frek10.html

4. ftp://ftp.spraakbanken.gu.se/pub/statistik/PAROLE/parole_most_freq_10k.tgz

   Note that swedish.words contains less than 25% of the
   parole_most_freq_10k and is modified a little. For any purpose
   other than this algorithm, we recommend going to the source,
   http://spraakbanken.gu.se.
