 1. must clean up the logging stuff

    Mostly done now. I need to do another quick sweep to ensure that the
    various Logs are created in the right context. Furthermore, the Loop
    should not be calling commit() for every Connection; and they should
    each set their Log/Arena correctly in their Scope.

 2. documentation and manual page updates
 3. check that the listener addresses in the code match the manpages

    I changed tlsproxy's default address to 127.0.0.1. Is anything else
    needed?

 4. bodystructure needs to send extended information

    Done. It was rather more work than I expected it would be.
    Needs a bit of testing (coming up).

 5. string needs encode/decode + CTE enum

    Done. A bit of a hack wrt e64's line-length parameter. Can QP use it
    too? (I seem to recall something about QP and line length.)

 6. tlsproxy must support real certificates

    Done. This is a horrible nightmare because of OpenSSL's non-standard
    private key storage format and cryptlib's inability to read it. Must
    talk to Arnt about how to do the right thing for the sysadmin.

 7. tlsproxy doesn't handle eof (or errors) well

    I'll look into this again later.

 8. schema diagram with sujai
 9. Fix startup and shutdown (and log disasters to stderr).
10. we need an install script that generates a config file
11. tls client support (smtp, postgresql)
12. move tests to another program
13. member-ify some of the static functions in message
14. get rid of some friends
15. the injector must share bodyparts
16. make sure ocd works
17. test with more imap clients (mutt, outlook, thunderbird, kmail, pine,
    evolution)
18. the gui should do something
19. resource limits on memory allocation
20. more testing
21. configuration overhaul
22. rfc2047 encoding
23. inject a large number of messages, collect query statistics
24. archives.oryx.com
25. make sure mailutil works with us
26. EXPUNGE is horribly broken
27. top-level message/rfc822 support
28. What to do about EventHandlers whose targets have died?
29. How does .PEEK work?
30. ~/imapd.valgrind
31. Get rid of Blah::setup wherever possible.
