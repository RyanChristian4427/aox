Injector fixes:

  1. Better error handling is urgently required.


Message fixes:

  1. Extra \r\n in the bodypart for o/1


LIST/LSUB fixes.

  There's lots of horrible breakage here (for example, the reference
  name is apparently just ignored).


Schema documentation

  I've done all I want to sql-schema.html and postgres.schema; I'll have
  to wait for Sujai's diagram to complete schema.html, but until then, I
  have done all I can to it.


Field name synchronisation

  If we ever need to add values to HeaderField::Type, new values must go
  AFTER ::Other, because we can't insert entries into the middle of the
  field_names table. So the type translation has to be done if the type
  is greater than or equal to Other.

  And we need to synchronise the in-memory maps via ocd anyway.


Fix shutdown

  there's no practical way to shutdown using ocd/ocadmin.


FETCH fixes:

  Currently we're always peeking; "fetch 1 body[1]" does not change
  the seen flag.


EXPUNGE fixes:

  We need to do what RFC2180 says.


Bodypart sharing

  We're doing an in-memory Dict< hash > right now.
  We could do better, but it might involve waiting.

  And, after some thought, I've decided that it doesn't belong in 0.90
  now. A great pity, but there it is.


Use SHA-1 to hash bodyparts instead of MD5.

  MD5 is broken, and we should be moving away from it.
  AMS needs to take code from RFC 3174 and make core/sha1.cpp.

tlsproxy doesn't handle eof (or errors) well


move tests to another program

the gui should do something

What to do about EventHandlers whose targets have died?


garbage collection (~/imapd.valgrind)


logging cleanups

  Mostly done now. I need to do another quick sweep to ensure that the
  various Logs are created in the right context. Furthermore, the Loop
  should not be calling commit() for every Connection; and they should
  each set their Log/Arena correctly in their Scope.


Miscellaneous cleanups:

  * get rid of Blah::setup wherever possible
  * member-ify some of the static functions in message
  * get rid of some friends


Inbox lifetime/mailbox reuse

  A newly created used needs an inbox. Since the user name may be the
  same as a former user, the mailbox may exist already, and may
  contain messages belonging to the former user.

  This behaviour has the benefit that "ms create user" is a perfect
  undelete for "ms delete user", but if the new user has no relation
  to the previous homonymous user, our behaviour is less desirable.

  I assume ms create user needs a command-line argument and msconsole
  needs to prompt its user.
