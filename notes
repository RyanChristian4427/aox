must clean up the logging stuff

  Mostly done now. I need to do another quick sweep to ensure that the
  various Logs are created in the right context. Furthermore, the Loop
  should not be calling commit() for every Connection; and they should
  each set their Log/Arena correctly in their Scope.

documentation and manual page updates
check that the listener addresses in the code match the manpages

  I changed tlsproxy's default address to 127.0.0.1. Is anything else
  needed?

bodystructure needs to send extended information

  Done. It was rather more work than I expected it would be.
  Needs a bit of testing (coming up).

string needs encode/decode + CTE enum

  Done. A bit of a hack wrt e64's line-length parameter. Can QP use it
  too? (I seem to recall something about QP and line length.)

tlsproxy must support real certificates

  Done. This is a horrible nightmare because of OpenSSL's non-standard
  private key storage format and cryptlib's inability to read it. Must
  talk to Arnt about how to do the right thing for the sysadmin.

tlsproxy doesn't handle eof (or errors) well

  I'll look into this again later.
