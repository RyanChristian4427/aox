# By default, LIBDIR/installer will create a Postgres user and database,
# and an unprivileged database user for the servers to use. If you want
# to use an existing user or database, set the variables below.
#
# Notes:
#
# - DBOWNER must own the DBNAME database.
# - Because PostgreSQL likes using ident authentication, it's convenient
#   if DBUSER is the same as ORYXUSER.
# - The installer will generate a password for both users, so you don't
#   have to set one here unless you want to use an existing user.
#
# These settings correspond to the db-name, db-owner, db-owner-password,
# db-user, and db-password variables in archiveopteryx.conf.
