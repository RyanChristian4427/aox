# By default, LIBDIR/installer will create a Postgres user and database,
# and an unprivileged database user for the servers to use. If you want
# to use an existing user or database, set the variables below.
#
# Notes:
#
# - DBOWNER must own the DBNAME database or the DBSCHEMA schema.
# - It is safe to leave DBSCHEMA unchanged; database objects will then
#   be installed into the default "public" schema.
# - Because Postgres likes to use ident authentication, we use AOXUSER
#   as both Unix user and unprivileged database user.
# - The installer will generate a password for both users, so you don't
#   have to set one here unless you want to use an existing user.
#
# These settings provide default values for the db-name, db-schema,
# db-owner, db-owner-password, and db-password configuration variables
# in archiveopteryx.conf. The value of db-user is derived from AOXUSER.
#
# (You can override these values when you run the installer.)
